OBJECTIVE
*********
The objective of the game of MONOPOLY is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property.

*********
GAMEPLAY
*********
Each turn has three phases:
    Throwing the dices - the player throws two dices and moves the resulting number of spaces on the board, in a clock-wise direction.
    Applying the effects - the player acts according to whatever the space he land on asks him to do.
    Ending the turn - the player can buy, sell, or directly end the turn.

*********
BOARD
*********
The game board is made of 40 spaces:

"Start"
Each time a player's MONOPOLY token lands on or passes over "Start", whether by throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Bank pays him $200 salary.

Properties
When a player lands on MONOPOLY property owned by another player the owner collects rent from him. Whenever a player lands on an unowned MONOPOLY property he may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.

"Chance" & "Community"
When a player lands on either of these spaces on the MONOPOLY game board, he takes the top card from the deck indicated, follows the instructions and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.

"Income Tax"
When a player lands on the "Income Tax" space of the MONOPOLY game board, he must pay the indicated value to the bank.

"Go to Jail"
When a player lands on the "Go to Jail" space of the MONOPOLY game board, he is sent to Jail for 2 turns. A player can be freed early be getting doubles on the dices.

"Jail" & "Free Parking"
When a player lands on the "Jail" or "Free Parking" spaces of the MONOPOLY game board, NOTHING happens.

When you own all the MONOPOLY building lots in a color-group you may buy houses from the Bank and erect them on those properties. Additionally, building lots without houses in that group double their rent value.

*********
BANKRUPTCY

A player loses when he gets to the end of turn with debts and has no way to pay them.
